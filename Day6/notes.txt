16. Loops 
(iv). While loop 
--> The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 
(v). do-while loop 
--> do while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false.
How it works - 
= The body of loop is executed.
= If the condition is true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again. 
= The condition is evaluated again. 
= If the condition evaluates to true, the body inside the do statement is executed again.
= The process continues until the condition evaluates to false. Then the loop stops.

Note* - do-while loop is similar to the while loop. The only  difference is that in do-while loop, the body of loop is executed at least once.


17. Strings 
--> String is collection of characters or a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. It is a primitive datatype and immutable which means they cannot be changed.
