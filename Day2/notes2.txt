9 - JS Engine.
(i). Now to run JS code, we need JS engine, earlier it was believed that JS code can be run only in browser and only client side applications can be created. 
(ii). So all the browsers are having their own JS Engines to run JS code.
(iii). Later Ryan Dahl wrote some C++ and tried to run it using JS Engine, and it worked and we call it Node.JS.
(iv). So JS can be used for client-side application and server-side application as well, it just requries JS engine to run the code.
Note* - Angular and view are frameworks of Typescript. While React is framework of both JavaScript and typescript. Not only that but React.JS is a JS library which is used to create Websites and React native is JS framework which is used to create Mobile Applications.
Some Browser Engines -:
Google Chrome = V8 Engine
Mozilla FireFox = Monkey Spider Engine
Internet Explorer = Chakra

10 - Add JS to HTML Page 
(i). We can use script tag in <body> tag of HTML file.
(ii). This script tag should be placed at the end of body tag means after complete HTML code.
(iii). <script src=./index.js"></script>

11 - JS Code Execution
--> Below are the few terminologies which comes under JS code execution :
a. Global Execution Context 
b. Execution Context
c. Call Stack
d. Memory Allocation
e. Code Execution

12. Variables (var, let and const are three variables and keywords both)
--> Variables are containers. They store data values. for ex: var x = 5;
    In programming, just like in mathematics, we use variables to hold values like x = 5. 5 is the value stores in variable x.
    syntax : var(variable declaration) foo(variable name) = 11(value of the variable);

    Variables can be created in JS using these: 
    var
    let
    const

13. Datatypes 
--> There are two types of datatypes :
(i). Primitive Datatypes = Number, string, Bookean, null, undefined, not defined.
(ii). Non-Primitive datatypes = Object, Array, Function
