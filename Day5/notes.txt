16. Loops 
--> Below are the loops available in JS: 
(i). for loop -:
syntax : for(intialExpression; condition; updateExpression){
    code to be executed.
}
-->intialExpression = initializes or declares variables and executes only once.
-->condition = a - if condition is false, loop is terminated.
            b - if condition is true, code block executes.
-->updateExpression = updates the value of the initialExpression , when the condition is true.

(ii). for-in loop - In each iteration of the loop, a key is assigned to the key variable. The loop continues for all object properties. Once you get keys, you can easily find their corresponding values.
(iii). for-of loop 
(iv). while
(v). do-while loop
